# Advertisement Sales Prediction Using Logistic_Regression

## Introduction
This Python script builds a machine learning model to predict whether a new customer will buy a product based on their age and salary. It uses logistic regression as the underlying algorithm.

## Prerequisites
To run this script, ensure you have the following installed:

1. Python 3.x
2. pandas
3. numpy
4. scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Download the dataset named 'DigitalAd_dataset.csv'.
2. Place the dataset file in the same directory as the script.
3. Execute the script.

## Instructions
1. The script prompts the user to enter the new customer's age and salary.
2. Based on the input, it predicts whether the customer will buy the product or not.
3. The prediction is displayed along with an interpretation.
4. Additionally, the script evaluates the model's accuracy and displays a confusion matrix.

## File Description
1. DigitalAd_dataset.csv: Dataset containing age, salary, and purchase status.
2. Advertisement_Sales_Prediction_Using_Logistic_Regression.ipynb.py: Python script implementing the predictive model.

## Additional Notes
1. Ensure the dataset file is correctly formatted and contains the necessary columns.
2. The script uses logistic regression for binary classification.
3. It employs train-test split for model validation.
4. Standard scaling is applied to normalize the feature values.
